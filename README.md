# MooshieUI

MooshieUI is a beginner-friendly interface for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) that runs in two modes:
- **Desktop app** via Tauri (Windows/Linux, macOS source build)
- **Browser/server mode** via the built-in web server (LAN/Docker friendly, mobile UI)

Built with **Svelte 5** + **Rust**, it hides ComfyUI's node-graph complexity behind a clean, guided workflow so you can generate without hand-editing graphs.

## NewUI Fork Features

NewUI is the redesigned interface variant in this personal fork. It keeps MooshieUI's ComfyUI workflow while focusing on a more flexible workspace, clearer controls, and better touch interaction.

### 主要特色

- **全新 Studio 生成工作区**：提供 Studio Workbench 和 Focus Preview 两种桌面布局，可将生成控制集中到左侧或右侧，并支持左右面板交换。
- **更好的移动端体验**：支持顶部快速面板控制或边缘滑出控制，生成按钮固定在底部操作区，Gallery、Model Hub 和 Settings 也针对小屏幕重新排版。
- **Inpainting Canvas Editor**：在局部重绘时可独立开启 Canvas Editor，快速切换画布、遮罩和生成控制。
- **提示词收藏库**：支持保存、搜索、编辑、删除、分组和导出提示词，并可从历史记录或生成面板直接复用。
- **服务器目录浏览器**：可浏览服务器端目录，使用路径输入、上级目录、前进后退和位置导航选择模型、画廊及自动保存目录。
- **更可靠的模型路径识别**：根据模型实际所在目录判断加载类别，减少 checkpoint 与 split model 切换后的加载错误。
- **更多外观设置**：可选择生成页布局、控制面板位置、移动端面板操作方式和按钮阴影质量。
- **Fork 更新提示**：明确区分 Fork Releases 与官方 MooshieUI 更新，自动更新保持关闭并支持手动下载。

### NewUI highlights

- A redesigned Studio generation workspace with Workbench and Focus Preview layouts.
- Swappable left and right control panels, persistent panel sizing, and a clearer command bar.
- Touch-friendly mobile controls with quick actions, edge handles, and a bottom generation dock.
- A dedicated Canvas Editor toggle for inpainting workflows.
- A prompt library with saved prompts, search, groups, editing, export, and history reuse.
- A server-side directory browser for model, gallery, and save paths.
- More reliable physical model-folder detection for checkpoint and split-model loading.
- Additional appearance preferences for layout, panel controls, and button shadow quality.

NewUI is an unofficial personal fork. Automatic updates are disabled for this build. Download fork builds from the [Fork Releases](https://github.com/cyaeq/MooshieUI-fork/releases) page, and use the [official MooshieUI releases](https://github.com/Mooshieblob1/MooshieUI/releases) for upstream versions.

## 📦 Quick Start

### Desktop (Windows/Linux)

1. Download a release from [Releases](https://github.com/Mooshieblob1/MooshieUI/releases).
2. Run the app. The setup wizard downloads uv, Python, ComfyUI, and PyTorch (NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel Arc GPU auto-detected) and installs MooshieUI's custom nodes - no Python or pip setup required.
3. Start generating; ComfyUI launches automatically.

> ~5–10 GB disk, 5–15 minutes on first launch. macOS, Docker, and remote/cloud ComfyUI setups are covered in [Installation](https://github.com/Mooshieblob1/MooshieUI/wiki/Installation).

### Self-host (Docker)

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # optional: credentials/ports
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open `http://localhost:3200` (or your configured `MOOSHIEUI_PORT`). Full server/LAN/multi-user setup: [Server, LAN & Multi-User](https://github.com/Mooshieblob1/MooshieUI/wiki/Server,-LAN-and-Multi-User).

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mooshieblob1/MooshieUI.git
cd MooshieUI
npm install
npm run tauri dev      # hot-reload dev
npm run tauri build    # production build
```

---

## 🏗️ How it works

1. You adjust settings in the Svelte UI.
2. On Generate, settings go to the Rust backend via the IPC bridge (`ipcInvoke()` on desktop, HTTP/SSE in browser mode).
3. Rust builds a ComfyUI workflow JSON from templates - no node graph exposed.
4. The workflow is submitted to ComfyUI's `/prompt` API.
5. WebSocket streams progress and previews back to the UI in real time.

MooshieUI also ships custom ComfyUI nodes (tiled diffusion, soft/smart guidance, an SDXL↔Flux2 VAE adapter, Nanosaur DiT support, and face fix) that are auto-installed into ComfyUI. Details live in [Models & the Model Hub](https://github.com/Mooshieblob1/MooshieUI/wiki/Models-and-the-Model-Hub). The tiled diffusion node is also available as a standalone ComfyUI custom node: [ComfyUI-MooshieTiledDiffusion](https://github.com/Mooshieblob1/ComfyUI-MooshieTiledDiffusion).

## 🔒 Security

Automated **GlassWorm resistance checks** run on every push and pull request to catch supply-chain attacks that hide payloads in invisible Unicode variation selectors or tamper with git timestamps. The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/glassworm-scan.yml`) blocks merges on failure. Contributors should enable the same checks locally:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-hooks.sh
```

## 💛 Support & Where the Money Goes

First off, to be clear: **this is not meant to be income.** MooshieUI is a passion project. I build it in my spare time around a regular day job, I don't expect to earn anything from it, and right now the running costs come straight out of my own pocket.

If you [sponsor the project](https://github.com/sponsors/Mooshieblob1), here is exactly where it goes:

- **Domain & hosting** - keeping the project site and download links online.
- **SaaS & dev tooling** - the paid services and tools used to actually build and ship MooshieUI.
- **GitHub Pro+** - CI/CD minutes for the build, release, and security-scan pipelines.

The goal is simply to stop the project from costing me money to keep alive. Anything beyond covering costs just goes right back into building more features, faster.

Longer term, the ideal is that MooshieUI can outlast my own availability. I intend to support this project for as long as I can, but every maintainer has lulls, and life can pull you away for a stretch. A small buffer means the domain, hosting, and infrastructure stay paid up through those quiet periods, so the project stays online and usable even when I am not actively maintaining it.

Sponsoring is completely optional and the app will always be free and open source either way. Thank you for even considering it. 🙏

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

MooshieUI stands on the shoulders of a huge amount of open-source work. Sincere thanks to every project, researcher, model creator, and service below.

### Core foundations

- **[Tauri](https://tauri.app/)** - the Rust desktop app framework, plus its store, shell, dialog, fs, clipboard, updater, and process plugins.
- **[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)**, **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**, **[Vite](https://vite.dev/)**, and **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - the frontend stack.
- **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)** - the ML framework behind ComfyUI inference.
- **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** (Astral) - manages Python and the ComfyUI environment during setup.

### Inference runtimes

- **[AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)** - legacy metadata parsing and the `(tag:1.1)` weight syntax.
- **[InvokeAI](https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI)** and **[NovelAI](https://novelai.net/)** - additional prompt weight syntaxes MooshieUI understands and converts.
- **[stealth-pnginfo](https://github.com/ashen-sensored/sd_webui_stealth_pnginfo)** (ashen-sensored) - the alpha-channel metadata embedding technique.
- **[ComfyUI Impact Pack](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack)** (ltdrdata) - the face-detailer concept that MooshieUI's lightweight FaceDetailer node reimplements.

### Data & services

- **[CivitAI](https://civitai.com/)** - model search, hash lookup, and metadata.
- **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)** - hosting for nearly every model MooshieUI downloads.
- **[Danbooru](https://danbooru.donmai.us/)** and **[Gelbooru](https://gelbooru.com/)** - the tag taxonomies behind autocomplete (~140k tags; Gelbooru-derived Anima list curated by [BetaDoggo](https://huggingface.co/BetaDoggo)).
- **[Animadex](https://animadex.net/)** - the character and LoRA database integration.
- **[Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/)** - the embedded full image editor.
